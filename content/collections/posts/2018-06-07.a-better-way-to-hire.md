Have you figured out your &#8220;people&#8221; strategy?

Meaning, your strategy for hiring your first teammates without wiping out your cashflow or taking on serious debt?

And your strategy for scaling your team without sacrificing quality?

And your strategy for avoiding micro-management and straining working relationships?

Unfortunately, there is too much conventional hiring advice out there that leads too many tiny businesses into cash crunches, stress spirals, and poor decisions. So I want to share some unconventional advice for us bootstrappers and productizers who do want to grow a company, but do so in a sustainable, profitable way.

Ready my article, <a href="https://productizeandscale.com/start-hiring-scale-your-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>A Better Way to Hire & Scale Your Team</em></a>, over on my Productize & Scale blog.
