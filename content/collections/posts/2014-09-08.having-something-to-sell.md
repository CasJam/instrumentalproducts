A few weeks back, I was having a conversation with one of my students in the Productize course, and something he said really stood out to me.

It was after I asked the question, what do you see as your biggest challenge right now? He responded:

_&#8220;Well, I feel pretty confident with where my technical skills are at. But I don&#8217;t see a clear path to double my business in the next year. I think that&#8217;s because I don&#8217;t have **something to sell** (other than my time).&#8221;_

That reminded me why I chose to productize my business in the first place.  I was tired of writing proposal after proposal, every time reinventing my service to fit the particular needs of every new client. And I&#8217;m hearing the same thing from everyone I&#8217;ve been talking to.

By positioning your service as a product, you can say goodbye to writing proposals and estimates for good.  That&#8217;s because a productized service gives you something to sell — and that&#8217;s your vehicle to growing your business to the next level.
