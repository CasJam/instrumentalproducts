As you probably saw, I ask everyone who subscribes to my newsletter a few questions. Although I don&#8217;t always have the time to reply to everyone, I do read each and every response.

I love hearing about the unique stories. They&#8217;re truly inspiring. But I also hear plenty of challenges that everyone seems to share (myself included).

When I asked you: &#8220;What&#8217;s the biggest challenge standing in your way?&#8221; You know what the single most common response I heard was?

Time.

Everybody needs to find more time to work on their business and change it for the better. When you&#8217;re completely consumed in client work or family time or a job, how will you ever make time for things like launching a new product, blogging, or doing customer research?

I hope you&#8217;ll find these strategies helpful. They&#8217;re things that I did over the years that helped me transform the way my business works.
