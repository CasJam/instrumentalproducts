Let&#8217;s talk about _finishing_.

We focus so much of our time and interest on _starting_.  The idea.  The plan.  The product.  The momentum.

Most of us are excellent starters.  Very few of us are _finishers_.

We see others launch and grow products.  It&#8217;s inspiring!  Because all we see is the final version, the finishing touches, the polish, the stuff intended to be seen.

What we don&#8217;t see is the grunt work, the trials and errors, the drafts that were scrapped along the way.  We don&#8217;t see or feel the self-doubt, the second guessing, and the emotional toll of pushing through that.  We don&#8217;t see the ruthless management of time required to make room for creating and finishing _on time_.

Finishers know the risks.  They know what the work looks like.  They know what it feels like to do the work when they&#8217;re not in the mood.

The excitement of starting only gets you 10% of the way there.  The other 90% is the work and discipline required to finish.

The more you optimize for finishing, the more things you&#8217;ll finish.

The more things you finish, the more you learn.

The more you learn, the better you get at choosing what to start.
