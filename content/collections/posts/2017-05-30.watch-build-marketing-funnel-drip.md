Do you use [Drip](https://www.drip.co) for email marketing automation tool? I do. My team and I love it.

The automation. The possibilities!

There&#8217;s a lot you _could_ do with Drip, but you&#8217;re probably wondering what you _should_ do with Drip. Is this you? Well, I&#8217;ve got a treat for you today (several treats, actually).

My goal here is to help you build a _strategy_ to put Drip to use when it comes to building out your marketing funnel.

That&#8217;s what led me to build out my collection of <a href="https://automationguides.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Automation Guides</a> on setting up your Drip or ActiveCampaign account.

But the pre-curser to those was this lengthy walkthrough of the workflows I had set up for my Audience Ops business&#8217; Drip account.

In <a href="https://audienceops.com/drip-email-automation-teardown-content-marketing-funnel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my article</a> over on the Audience Ops blog, you&#8217;ll find:

  * My 30-minute video teardown of our (live) Drip account and workflows that power our own content marketing funnel at [Audience Ops](https://audienceops.com).
  * A guide and framework you can use to build your own automated funnel in Drip.
  * A bonus 10-step process and cheatsheet you can download and follow right now when you&#8217;re setting up your Drip account.
