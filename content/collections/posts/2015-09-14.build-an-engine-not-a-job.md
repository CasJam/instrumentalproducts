You know what your biggest hurdle is when you&#8217;re starting up something new?

It&#8217;s not building a product, or getting customers. It&#8217;s burnout. You lose steam on doing the work before that work has a chance to bring results.

Today&#8217;s article shows you how I&#8217;ve been looking at work differently than I used to. It&#8217;s all about looking at each project like I&#8217;m building an engine, designed to out pace the burnout factor. Have a read and let me know what you think.
