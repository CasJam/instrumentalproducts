It occurred to me that honing my skills as a manager of people is probably the biggest area of focus for me personally in my business these past few years.  I also receive a lot of questions about hiring first employees and the fear of going from working solo to managing a team.

So I felt it&#8217;s time to write up my (long-ish) guide to what I&#8217;ve learned about figuring out that &#8220;Management&#8221; thing.

In a nutshell, like anything else, it doesn&#8217;t happen overnight.  You move through various levels of managing people.  I wrote about my experience at each level, giving you prerequisites and things you&#8217;ll learn at each stage.
