One of the biggest deciding factors when I started my business,Â <a href="http://audienceops.com" data-cke-saved-href="http://audienceops.com">Audience Ops</a>, was that I&#8217;d be able to use it as a teachable case study. It is, afterall, a productized service business!

In the early days of this business, it was all about landing those first paying customers. To my surprise I landed 4 in the first month! Selling a productized service is way easier than anything else I&#8217;ve done&#8230; But once those first clients came onboard, then came the hard (fun) part:
