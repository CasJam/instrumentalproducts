        text: 'They wildly under-estimate the time they will take to build a product. They perpetually blow past their stated ship date. More times than not, that product that’s pertetually “coming soon” ends up on the shelf instead of in the hands of customers.'

        text: 'On time. Every time. Often sooner than planned. While others are losing steam (or budget) on their over-extended projects, the shippers already have customers using their V1. They’re taking feedback to work on their V2. They’re off and running.'

        text: 'As a natural builder myself, I’ve learned this the hard way: The skill of building things can work against my ability to make wise—fast—business decisions. But I learned that this friction can be tamed and turned into an asset.'

        text: 'I often delegate when the blocker doesn’t play well with my personal strengths. I assemble a small crew of teammates around me who thrive in areas that I don’t. The hard parts for me are the easy parts for them. So the right decision is to pause and hand off a task so that both my teammate and I can focus our time on the tasks that play to our strengths (where we move fast).'

Here, the call is to push it to the back of our roadmap. It’s a decision to decide on this one later. It’s possible that the progress we’ll make between now and then will remove this blocker altogether by the time we return to it.'

But don’t mistake it: This too is a business decision. Often, it’s based on an expectation that this won’t be the last time I see this particular blocker. So I’ll decide to gain the solution now, so that I can add it to my toolbelt for later.'
