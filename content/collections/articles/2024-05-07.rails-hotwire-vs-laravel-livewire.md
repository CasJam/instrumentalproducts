The basic syntax constantly tripped me up (though today's AI coding tools like GitHub Copilot do help a lot with this).  Compared to Ruby (and Rails), PHP requires a lot more structure and literally more lines of code to make programs work—and it's a lot less forgiving.  When writing Ruby, I can often guess what the most logical method name or syntax likely is without looking it up.  Not the case with PHP."
