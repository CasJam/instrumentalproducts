      title="Let‚Äôs build & launch a whole product!" 
      link_text="Learn more..." }}

    <p>
      Me (and my tiny crew) will work with you to go from idea to design, code and launch of your V1 to customers.
    </p>

    <p>
      This can happen in as fast as 3 months (lean & mean shipping speed).
    </p>

    <p>
      I (Brian) leads the whole project, from vetting and refining the product idea and scope, to design, architecture, and product management through launch.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'll bring on a dev or 2 (at my cost) to speed up the build and get the product in your customers hands as efficiently as possible.
    </p>


    <p>
      After we ship your V1 to customers, if you need continued support, we‚Äôve got you covered. Your post-launch options range from transferring the dev(s) who worked on your v1 into your direct employment, keeping us on for fractional product management, or continuous development retainers.
    </p>

    <h3>How much?</h3>

    <p>
      All-in, you‚Äôre looking at a 5-figure investment and a couple months timeline. We‚Äôll dial in the proposal so that there are no surprises.
    </p>

    <p>
      For select opportunities, we can discuss a discount in exchange for equity in your new product. Let‚Äôs talk.

      title="Let‚Äôs shape up something new in a 2-week sprint!" 
      link_text="Learn more..." }}

    <p>
      That big idea has been sitting dormant for months (years?). Why?
    </p>

    <p>
      You haven‚Äôt been able to start it due to lack of bandwidth, resources, team, (insert your preferred excuse here üôÉ). I get it. The hardest part of these big hairy projects is starting!
    </p>

    <p>
      Bring me in to give this idea the starting energy it needs.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a 2-week planning sprint, I‚Äôll work with you to take this idea from concept to a tangeable project that‚Äôs shaped-up, scoped-down, and ready to build.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>A call or two to talk goals and ideas</li>
      <li>Daily(ish) async messages as I dig into the details</li>
      <li>Thoughtfully prepared strategic plans for implementation</li>
      <li>Visual wireframes and rough mockups (where needed)</li>
      <li>Detailed technical specs ready for any technical team to run with</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These planning sprints have worked well for:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Overhauling your customer onboarding flow</li>
      <li>Planning a new customer learning center</li>
      <li>Scoping and shaping a big new feature</li>
      <li>Planning a mobile app for a SaaS</li>
      <li>Planning a white labeled version of a product</li>
      <li><em>Or any other big product initiative to get off the ground!</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
      How much?

      2-week planning sprints have a 4-figure price tag and can be repeated throughout the year (pending availability).

    <p>
      When you‚Äôve got something specific and need a 2nd pair of eyes, ears, some fresh ideas, a sounding board, or quick technical help, this option is (usually) available.
    </p>

    <p>
      This 1-week thing includes the following:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Send me a video laying out your main question or thing you want my input on.</li>
      <li>I‚Äôll send you my detailed, thoughtful response on video within 2 business days.</li>
      <li>A few more async followup questions in the days that follow.</li>
      <li>All messages recorded, logged, downloadable, and easy to refer back to.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pitch me your idea!</strong> I‚Äôll break down some pros, cons, gotchas, and have you thought of‚Äôs?</li>
      <li><strong>Interface review.</strong> Show me your UI for a specific part of your product and I‚Äôll share my thoughts on how to make it simpler and easier to use.</li>
      <li><strong>Onboarding review.</strong> Show me your customer‚Äôs onboarding flow and I‚Äôll offer ideas how to improve conversions and retention.</li>
      <li><strong>Roadmap review.</strong> Show me your plan (or the plan your devs gave you) and I‚Äôll poke holes in it and tell you if I spot any inconsistencies or red flags.</li>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hiring first team members.</strong> Growing from a team of one to a few is one of the hardest hurdles. I‚Äôve grown teams of 25+. Let‚Äôs talk about it.</li>
      <li><strong>SaaS startups.</strong> Self-funding & sustaining. Finding shortcuts. SaaS gotchas‚Ä¶</li>
      <li><strong>Productized consulting.</strong> I used to be known as the ‚ÄúProductized Service‚Äù guy. I even built and sold a productized service business. Ask me anything.</li>
      <li><strong>Product marketing.</strong> Website design teardown. Copywriting review. Navigating your funnel. Signup flows. Let‚Äôs take a look!</li>

      <li><strong>Learn to code.</strong> Whether you‚Äôre learning front-end or back-end (or both), I‚Äôll help dial in your learning plan.</li>
      <li><strong>Learning Ruby on Rails.</strong> Learning RoR and hit a roadblock? Let‚Äôs take a look. I can probably un-block you (for good).</li>
      <li><strong>Learning design.</strong> Figma. User interfaces. Marketing site design. Layouts. User experience. Let‚Äôs clean it up and dial it in!</li>
      <li><strong>TailwindCSS.</strong> Front-end HTML & CSS was my love-language early on. Today, it‚Äôs TailwindCSS. I can help you build and design-in-browser with efficiency.</li>
      <li><strong>Vanilla Javascript.</strong> I‚Äôm no React wizard, but I love me some plain vanilla Javascript (and lightweight tools like Alpine JS and Stimulus JS). I can help :)</li>
