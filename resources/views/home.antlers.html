      <p>
        We work with you to nail down the core problem we're solving, who we're solving it for, and shaping up a clear and focused product roadmap.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Customer research (we love the <em>jobs to be done</em> approach)</li>
        <li>Product planning (shaping up the right-sized scope for V1 and beyond)</li>
        <li>Technical planning (catching complexities and blockers before they happen)</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Wireframes and mockups (visual concepts we can discuss and use to guide development)</li>
        <li>Front-end UI development (we love TailwindCSS and lightweight Javascript interactions)</li>
