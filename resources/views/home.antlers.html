        From concept to launched.
      </h1>

      <p>
        As a full stack product developer, I take new products from initial concept and strategy, to design, code, and launched to customers.
      </p>

      <p>
        I bring something of a killer combo to SaaS companies as both a multi-time founder myself <em>and</em> a full stack designer and developer.

              <p>
                That connection with your people has enabled you to build a thriving business selling courses, memberships, sponsorships or the like… That’s awesome!

              <p>
                You’ve got the audience distribution advantage.

              <p>
                Maybe you even have a software product idea that you know your audience already buys (and would happily be your first customers).

              <p>
                But you’re not a product developer, and the idea of hiring just anyone is… A little daunting.

              <p>
                Me (and my tiny crew) will work with you to go from idea to design, code and launch of your V1 to customers.
              </p>

              <p>
                This can happen in as fast as 3 months (lean & mean shipping speed).
              </p>

              <p>
                I (Brian) leads the whole project, from vetting and refining the product idea and scope, to design, architecture, and product management through launch.
              </p>

              <p>
                I'll bring on a dev or 2 (at my cost) to speed up the build and get the product in your customers hands as efficiently as possible.
              </p>


              <p>
                After we ship your V1 to customers, if you need continued support, we’ve got you covered. Your post-launch options range from transferring the dev(s) who worked on your v1 into your direct employment, keeping us on for fractional product management, or continuous development retainers.
              </p>

              <h3>How much?</h3>

              <p>
                All-in, you’re looking at a 5-figure investment and a couple months timeline. We’ll dial in the proposal so that there are no surprises.
              </p>

              <p>
                For select opportunities, we can discuss a discount in exchange for equity in your new product. Let’s talk.

              <p>
                That big idea has been sitting dormant for months (years?). Why?
              </p>

              <p>
                You haven’t been able to start it due to lack of bandwidth, resources, team, (insert your preferred excuse here 🙃). I get it. The hardest part of these big hairy projects is starting!
              </p>

              <p>
                Bring me in to give this idea the starting energy it needs.
              </p>

              <p>
                In a 2-week planning sprint, I’ll work with you to take this idea from concept to a tangeable project that’s shaped-up, scoped-down, and ready to build.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>A call or two to talk goals and ideas</li>
                <li>Daily(ish) async messages as I dig into the details</li>
                <li>Thoughtfully prepared strategic plans for implementation</li>
                <li>Visual wireframes and rough mockups (where needed)</li>
                <li>Detailed technical specs ready for any technical team to run with</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                These planning sprints have worked well for:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Overhauling your customer onboarding flow</li>
                <li>Planning a new customer learning center</li>
                <li>Scoping and shaping a big new feature</li>
                <li>Planning a mobile app for a SaaS</li>
                <li>Planning a white labeled version of a product</li>
                <li><em>Or any other big product initiative to get off the ground!</em></li>
              </ul>

                When you’ve got something specific and need a 2nd pair of eyes, ears, some fresh ideas, a sounding board, or quick technical help, this option is (usually) available.
              </p>

              <p>
                This 1-week thing includes the following:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Send me a video laying out your main question or thing you want my input on.</li>
                <li>I’ll send you my detailed, thoughtful response on video within 2 business days.</li>
                <li>A few more async followup questions in the days that follow.</li>
                <li>All messages recorded, logged, downloadable, and easy to refer back to.</li>
