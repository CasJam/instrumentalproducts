message: "Hey Brian, \r\n\r\nWe're working on the first software product that we fully own + I was curious to learn a bit more about how you partner with companies. One area we could really use some help with is product design, i.e. converting features/user requirements into a clear, detailed Figma design spec so that our engineers have clarity in terms of what they're shipping. \r\n\r\nWe've worked with a number of designers so far but have struggled to find any that understand the vision + can deliver to my standards. So much so that I am considering bringing onboard a designer as a co-founder + issuing them equity (problem is we can't afford significant salary for what the \"best\" UI/UX designer would want right now as the product is pre-revenue and doing so wouldn't make sense) . \r\n\r\nTake care & talk soon! \r\n\r\nBest, \r\n\r\nAlex"
