subject: 'Starting a new SaaS'
message: "Hey Brian,\r\n\r\nJack here. You might know me from WordPress-land, I'm the founder of https://wpfusion.com/ and https://fatalerrornotify.com/. I'm a friend of Chris Lema's.\r\n\r\nI'm getting tired of WordPress ðŸ˜…. And I have an idea for a SaaS. I'm ready to move forward with it but I'm trying to figure out how much to handle with my existing team, vs working with somebody like yourself. This would be an entirely new tech stack for us, and I want to get an MVP up and running quickly... so I don't want to get personally bogged down in tech choices.\r\n\r\nI just read your tweet (your... X? ðŸ™ƒ) about selecting a stack and I think we're aligned in our philosophies. I've checked out your portfolio and I like your design instincts, and I think there's a lot of overlap in the technologies we'd be looking to use.\r\n\r\nWhat's the product? Essentially it's a real time activity feed for businesses (or political campaigns, newsrooms, fundraisers, etc). Like Metorik or BareMetrics, but event-driven instead of based on revenue. Probably most similar to BetterStack's \"logs\" feature, but aimed at the non-technical user. Or, like https://cashnotify.com/, but supporting any data source, not just payments.\r\n\r\nI'd love to chat if you're interested in the project and have availability. I know your time is valuable, I'd be happy to pay for a couple of hours of consulting just to get your feedback on the idea, and hear your thoughts on the tech stack, and then after that we could see if it's a good fit to work together on actually building the product.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing from you. Thanks,\r\nJack"
