message: "Hi there \r\nI just checked instrumentalproducts.com ranks and am sorry to bring this up, but it lacks in many areas. \r\n \r\nUnfortunately, building a bunch of links won't solve the issue in this case, and a more comprehensive strategy is required. Google has undergone significant changes over the past year, making it nearly impossible to compete for favorable rankings without a well-designed website. \r\n \r\nWe recommend a search engine-friendly website layout to resolve all issues and propel your site to the top. \r\n \r\nYou can check more details here: https://www.speed-seo.org/web-design/ \r\n \r\nThanks for your consideration \r\nMike Audley\r\nSpeed Designs \r\nhttps://www.speed-seo.org/whatsapp-us/"
