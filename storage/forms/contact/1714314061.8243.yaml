message: "Hi Brian, I've been a fan for a few years. Love your concept of productized services and that's basically what I've done with my apartment website templates at apartmentsites.com. My company is TourVista but that .com represents our old, initial, SaaS that's barely used. \r\n\r\nFor years I've been wanting to rebuild TourVista.com to better show off everything we do for apartment websites (see https://www.apartmentsites.com/solutions/) and actually do some marketing and grow the business. Currently have around 250 clients and want to get to 1,000.\r\n\r\nDo you think this would be a good fit for Instrumental Products?\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nMatt (Seattle, WA)"
