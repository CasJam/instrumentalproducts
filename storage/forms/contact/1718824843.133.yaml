message: "Hi Brian,\r\n\r\nI hope this message finds you well.\r\n\r\nMy name is Patrick Teague, a former soccer professional turned attorney based in New Orleans, originally from coastal Connecticut.\r\n\r\nIn March 2020, my Co-Founder and I started FIVEvTWOÂ® (www.fivevtwo.com), a soccer coaching and mentoring platform that leverages asynchronous communication through video and text, akin to Clarityflow. We launched our V1 in 2023, operating on a bootstrap budget.\r\n\r\nRegrettably, our company has faced challenges as my Co-Founder is battling a long-term, life-threatening illness and will not be able to return to his role.\r\n\r\nGiven your expertise and successful history in similar projects, I am reaching out to explore a potential partnership with you. We aim to expand FIVEvTWO into the global sports arena and as an educational resource within schools.\r\n\r\nI would love the opportunity to discuss this project with you further.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering this opportunity.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nPatrick Teague\r\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-teague-28a7a7114/"
