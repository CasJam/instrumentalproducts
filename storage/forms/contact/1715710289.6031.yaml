message: "Hey Brian,\r\n\r\nI'm a long time listener of Bootstrapped Web. I've really enjoyed following your journey and Jordan's!\r\n\r\nI'm reaching out because I think some of the things that helped me grow my SaaS could really help you with ClarityFlow. Honestly, I think the exact playbook I used would work great for you.\r\n\r\nI bootstrapped my SaaS (getskimmer.com) in a really niche market to 7 figures and had a really good exit.\r\n\r\nI've thought of reaching out a few times, but since we don't know each other I held back. However, after your last few podcast episodes, I decided to go ahead and reach out :)\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to hop on a 15 or 30 minute zoom call, I'd love to talk. Let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRon"
