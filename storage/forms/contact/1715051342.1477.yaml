message: "Hello Brian,\r\n\r\nMy name is Jessica Burch and I'm looking for a job that is fulfilling and offers mutual growth. I'm not just looking for any job, but rather the perfect one for me.\r\n\r\nTo give you a better idea about myself, I used to work as an elementary school teacher. But, I taught myself graphic design and marketing, started my own freelance writing business, and was able to leave the classroom.\r\n\r\nEventually, I landed a job as a Marketing Specialist in the corporate world. Things were going great until the company was acquired and I was laid off. I went back to contract work and then found another job in the corporate world. Unfortunately, the company was acquired again.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks ago, I was laid off for the second time in two years. Although it's frustrating, I'm not dwelling on it and am eager to move forward.\r\n\r\nI came across a job posting for a Marketing Coordinator/Social Media & Content Writer at ZipMessage that caught my attention. Brian, I think I could be a great fit for this position and I'm excited to explore it further.\r\n\r\nI attempted to apply through the listed channels, but I'm receiving an error message. This could be because the position is no longer available, but I wanted to reach out and ask if it's still open.\r\n\r\nI hope to hear from you soon,\r\n\r\nJessica Burch"
